## Features

- Decentralized Data Annotation
- Global Annotator Network
- Decentralized Data Storage
- Open Data Access
- Transparent Charity System

## Problem We're Solving

- Limited access to high-quality labeled datasets
- Data privacy and ownership issues
- Lack of transparency in data annotation
- Inefficiency in charitable fund distribution

## Our Solution

OpenAnnot operates on three interconnected layers:

1. **Decentralized Data Annotation**: Smart contracts ensure fairness and transparency.
2. **Decentralized Data Storage**: Using IPFS or Filecoin for tamper-proof, accessible storage.
3. **Decentralized Charity System**: Transparent, milestone-based fund distribution.

## How We Use Stellar

OpenAnnott integrates Stellar blockchain technology in several key ways:

1. **Global Payments**: Utilizing Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions to reward annotators worldwide instantly.
2. **Custom Asset**: We've created the OpenAnnot Token (OAT) on the Stellar network for platform-specific transactions.
3. **Multi-signature Escrow**: Implementing Stellar's multi-sig functionality for secure and transparent management of the charity fund pool.
4. **Decentralized Exchange**: Leveraging Stellar's built-in DEX for easy conversion between OAT and other currencies.
5. **Cross-Border Transactions**: Using Stellar's efficient cross-border payment capabilities to facilitate a truly global annotator network.
